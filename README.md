**Cardio Good Fitness (Python_project)**

_Deep Dive into EDA with Python_ 

I recently completed a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) case study using Python. The objective was to identify customer characteristics for the "Cardio Good Fitness" retail store.

_My Approach:_

Data Cleaning :
Handled missing values and standardized data types using Pandas, and Numpy.

Univariate Analysis :
Analyzed distributions of Age, Income, and Usage using histograms and boxplots.

Multivariate Analysis :
Used Seaborn to create Correlation Heatmaps and Scatterplots, revealing a strong cluster of high-income, high-usage customers for the flagship product.

_Key Findings :_

The "Income Gap": The high-end TM798 model is almost exclusively purchased by customers earning above 70k, with a clear correlation between high education levels and premium product choice.

While the entry-level models have a balanced gender split, the high-performance model is purchased predominantly by male customers (approx. 80%).

Self-rated fitness was a stronger predictor of model choice than Age.
